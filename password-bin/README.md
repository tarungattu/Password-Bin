# Password Manager - using Vite

This is a clean responsive password manager app i built with my bare hands, without using AI. It might not be a big deal right now, but building this myself has given me more development knowledge than i would have if i built it using AI.

I also containerized the application using docker, learning how to write and deploy web apps.
